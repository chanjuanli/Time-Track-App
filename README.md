## Self-Evaluation of the project
The project achieves the basic function of my plan, simple and usable. The good side of the project from my perspective is the modern and clean UI, I am trying to make the user interface aesthetic and clean so that it can display information intuitively.
Reading and writing files, and aggregating the same project into one to count the total time are the most challenging parts for me, but I also learn new things from the solving process.
In addition, my project can only track one project at the same time, if a user creates another project and wants to track back to the old project, they need to enter the same project name to continue, if the name is different, it will become a new project, so listing multi-project tracking history for users to select and continue directly will be better.
